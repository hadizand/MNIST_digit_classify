# MNIST_digit_classify
## MNIST_digit_classify with SVM polynomial kernel
This small project deals with MNIST hand-written digit classification problem. The train and test data are obtained   
from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv) and it contains 784 pixel values in columns and label\ 
for each digit. 
Using only 12000 training samples (out of 60000), 96% score is obtained and on the test data the score is 93%. \
Finally using [Mypaint](http://mypaint.org/), I have created images from 0 to 9. UsingImageMagick converter,\ 
the images were resized to 28X28 pixels and finally they were analyzed using the algorith optimized for MNIST data. 
70% of the samples were correctly classified i.e. 7 numbers were correctly identified among 10 (0-9) numbers.
